Organize Files:

    Create a folder (e.g., phish_server) and place index.html, login.php, and an empty creds.txt file in it.
    Set permissions on creds.txt to make it writable:

    touch creds.txt && chmod 666 creds.txt

Start the PHP Server:

    Open a terminal in the phish_server directory.
    Run the command:

        php -S 0.0.0.0:8080

        This command starts a local server accessible at http://localhost:8080. Replace 0.0.0.0 with your network IP to make it accessible on the local network.

    Test Access:
        Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or your network IP and port) to test the phishing page.

Section 3: Phishing Email Template

Compose a realistic phishing email to encourage the target to click on the phishing link. Ensure all content is carefully worded to avoid raising suspicion.
Example Email Template

Subject: "Security Alert: Unusual Login Attempt Detected"

Body:

    Dear [Userâ€™s Name],

    We detected a suspicious login attempt on your account. As a security measure, please verify your account by logging in at the link below:

    [Phishing URL]

    Failure to verify within 24 hours may result in account suspension.

    Regards,
    The Security Team

Section 4: Important Notes and Best Practices

    Ethical Use Only: This setup is intended strictly for controlled environments such as pentesting competitions or authorized labs.
    Network Configuration: Adjust network and firewall settings as needed to make the server accessible over the network.
    File Security: Delete creds.txt and any sensitive data after use to protect collected information and ensure ethical handling.
